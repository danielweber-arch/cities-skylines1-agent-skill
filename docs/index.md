## What This Repository Contains

- A Cities: Skylines 1 mod source tree under `src/`.
- A local HTTP API bridge on `http://127.0.0.1:32123`.
- Bash scripts (curl + jq) for build, launch, smoke tests, road inspection, repair loops, and saves.
- A Claude skill definition in `SKILL.md` and Skill UI metadata in `agents/openai.yaml`.

## Primary Workflow

1. Build and install the mod.
2. Resume a city through Steam and the Paradox Launcher.
3. Inspect API state before changing anything.
4. Apply one small command at a time.
5. Let the simulation settle, re-check state, then save.

See [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started) for setup and [Agent Workflow](/guide/usage) for the repair loop.
